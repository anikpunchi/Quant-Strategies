This repositiory is used to log my individual quantititaive finance projects. This will encompass various strategies and research that I learn throughout my journey, applied to multiple 
asset classes. It will include the most basic strategies that I have learnt through my initial exposure to quant finance and will progressviely have more and more complex projects as I 
gain more expertise and knowledge within this cutting edge field. 

Please do note that some of this projects will be in a jupyter notebook file, and since github cannot always open a .ipynb file successfully, the link to it via a google colab website will be shared in the READNE file for that project.
